Guessing Game
For the first program (Guessing Game), the program chooses a random secret number that is stored within its code. The program will then ask the user to guess a number in the range of 1 to 100. If the users guessed number is different from the choses number then the program will output a message that corresponds with users guess. The message will either say the guess is too high or too low. These hints will allow the user to guess again and again until their guess matches the programs chose number. In the midst of all these guess, the program keeps a numerical count of each guess and tallies them up. Once the correct number is guessed, the program then outputs a message of congratulations to the user along with a message with a total number of guesses. 
The output program of the following is below: 

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100 ...
Please guess a number: 50
50 is too high.
Please guess a number: 25
25 is too low.
Please guess a number: 30
30 is too high.
Please guess a number: 27
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 4 guess(es)!
